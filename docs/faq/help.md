## How to stay up to date about LUKSO?

You can follow LUKSO on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lukso_io), read the latest article on [Medium](https://medium.com/lukso) articles, and follow the announcements on the LUKSO [Discord](https://discord.gg/lukso) server.

## Where can I read the LUKSO Whitepaper?

Here is the link to read and download the [Official LUKSO Whitepaper](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/629f44560745074760731ba4/62b200bfe0af12186845519a_LUKSO_Whitepaper_V1-1.pdf).

## My question is not here. Where can I ask it?

If you can't find an answer to your question, you can head to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/lukso) server. We have various open channels where you can ask technical questions:

- `validators`: Node and Network related questions
- `dev-chat`: Questions about tools, backend, and dApps
- `standards`: Questsions about LSPs and their integration
- `documentation`: Improvement proposals for our technical guides

In addition, the most frequently asked questions will be added to this list.

## Where can I report regular issues for repositories and tools?

You can open an issue on any open code repository of the [LUKSO Network's GitHub](https://github.com/lukso-network) page. We are also preparing workflows to handle global issues and improvement proposals. In case you want to give feedback to private source code, like our Universal Profile Extension, please create an issue on our global [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/lukso-network/issue-tracker).

## Where can security issues be reported to?

Suppose it's a vulnerability or something that should not be shared with the public, please reach out to official team members within our developer channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/lukso). You can send a friend request in order to exchange more detailed information. We are also preparing a workflow to handle investigations and bug bounties in a unified format.

## Does LUKSO have grants or bug bounties?

We're happy to compensate if there are severe findings and vulnerabilities discovered. The compensation will depend on the scope of the error or bug. We do not share precise bounty amounts beforehand because of the wide range of possible discoveries.
