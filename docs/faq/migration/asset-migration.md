# Asset Migration

## Will Universal Profiles previously created on L14 be migrated to mainnet?

LUKSO will migrate all Universal Profiles previously created on the L14 Testnet by [The Dematerialised Marketplace](https://thedematerialised.com/), the [Universal Profile Explorer](https://universalprofile.cloud/) or official collaborations like [Out Of the Ether](https://outoftheether.net/). If you deployed custom profiles on older testnets, you would be responsible for migrating them to the mainnet yourself.

## Will previously acquired NFTs be migrated to mainnet?

LUKSO will migrate all previously issued NFTs by the [LUKSO](https://lukso.network/) and [The Dematerialised](https://thedematerialised.com/) brands, as well as official LUKSO collaborations. If you deployed custom assets and services on older testnets, you would be responsible for migrating them to the mainnet.
