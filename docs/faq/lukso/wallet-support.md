# Wallet Support

## Whats the best way to use LUKSO?

It's suggested to use the [Universal Profile Extension](../../guides/browser-extension/install-browser-extension.md) while interacting with apps and services on LUKSO. The extension offers you a much more user-friendly and feature-rich experience than you would get using regular wallets.

## Can the Universal Profile Extension be considered a wallet?

The Universal Profile Extension should not be classified as a wallet. While connected Universal Profiles can store assets, the extension serves as a comprehensive center for your blockchain interactions and reflects your on-chain persona with much more capabilities than just holding assets.

## Which wallets can be used with the LUKSO network?

LUKSO is an EVM-compatible network. Therefore, any Ethereum wallet that allows custom networks can be used on the LUKSO network. You can find all the parameters of the LUKSO mainnet within the [Network](../../networks/mainnet/parameters.md) section.

## Can I use hardware wallets like Ledger to store LYX?

Yes, you can use hardware wallets with Ethereum support, such as [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) or [Trezor](https://trezor.io/), to store LYX. Both can connect to browser-based wallets like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and then be used to send or receive tokens. To see your LYX, you must add the LUKSO Mainnet as a custom network. The parameters can be found in the [Network](../../networks/mainnet/parameters.md) section.

> MetaMask might show a _network duplication warning_. This is because the chain ID of the LUKSO mainnet (`42`) equals the Kovan testnet of Ethereum. The reference might be updated soon. It is nothing to worry about.
